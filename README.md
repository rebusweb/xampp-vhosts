# xampp vhosts
Xampp Vhosts config for auto domains.

Using this config file all your dirs in htdocs are accessible as urls according to pattern directory.local

Additionally to support laravel all dirs with laravel inside may be accesible according to pattern directory.laravel (keep in mind that for laravel you have to point to public dir inside).
